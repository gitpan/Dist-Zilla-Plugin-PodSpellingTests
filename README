NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodSpellingTests - Release tests for POD spelling

VERSION
    version 1.103491

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

        [PodSpellingTests]

    or:

        [PodSpellingTests]
        wordlist = Pod::Wordlist
        spell_cmd = aspell list
        stopwords = CPAN
        stopwords = github
        stopwords = stopwords
        stopwords = wordlist

    or, if you wanted to use my plugin bundle but just override this
    plugin's configuration:

        [@Filter]
        -bundle = @MARCEL
        -remove = PodSpellingTests

        [PodSpellingTests]
        wordlist = Pod::Wordlist
        spell_cmd = aspell list
        stopwords = CPAN
        stopwords = github
        stopwords = stopwords
        stopwords = wordlist

DESCRIPTION
    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following file:

      xt/release/pod-spell.t - a standard Test::Spelling test

METHODS
  wordlist
    The module name of a word list you wish to use that works with
    Test::Spelling.

    Defaults to Pod::Wordlist::hanekomu.

  spell_cmd
    If "spell_cmd" is set then "set_spell_cmd( your_spell_command );" is
    added to the test file to allow for custom spell check programs.

    Defaults to nothing.

  stopwords
    If stopwords is set then "add_stopwords( <DATA> )" is added to the test
    file and the words are added after the "__DATA__" section.

    "stopwords" can appear multiple times, one word per line.

    Defaults to nothing.
